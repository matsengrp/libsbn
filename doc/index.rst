Welcome to libsbn's documentation!

This is the documentation for interacting with libsbn from Python.
See the README on the `libsbn GitHub repository <https://github.com/phylovi/libsbn>`_ for installation and general description.

The design principle here is that *as much as is efficient* to be in Python.
So, we want Python users to be able to do everything needed to fit models, while having all of the tree manipulation and traversal happen in C++.
This does mean a reasonable amount is in C++, though: for example, if we want efficient gradients for phylogenetic model parameters, the C++ needs to have data structures for these models.

From the perspective of a Python user, code is broken into two packages.

* ``libsbn`` is the direct interface to the C++ code; this module is generated by `pybind11 <http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/>`_
* ``vip`` has all of the Python code; this module contains code to infer model parameters and do complete calculations

A typical workflow looks like:

1. Load some collection of trees into the ``libsbn`` tree cache that define the SBN support
2. Parse those trees to get the SBN support
3. Given this collection of trees, ``libsbn`` sets up data structures to hold SBN model parameters
4. Initialize a phylogenetic model in ``libsbn`` and set parameters
5. Sample trees given the SBN model parameters (these get stored in the ``libsbn`` tree cache, over-writing the previously-cached trees)
6. Set branch lengths for these trees according to some model (``libsbn`` makes branch length vectors accessible as NumPy arrays)
7. Evaluate model likelihoods and gradients in ``libsbn``
8. Modify parameters and go back to 5.

The ``vip`` module facilitates this loop, both by having code that calls ``libsbn``, but also by having models for the ``libsbn`` parameters.
For example, ``libsbn`` doesn't have a data structure that contains a *model* of branch lengths--- it only has a way of setting the branch lengths.
Thus ``vip`` has branch length models, including models based on split and primary subsplit pairs (PSPs).
On the other hand, ``libsbn`` has a lot of functionality that make these models easy to put together on the Python side, such as the ``PSPIndexer`` that gives the indices needed to do PSP model calculations.

Thus, there are typically two levels of state: the "raw" parameters in the ``libsbn`` module, and the parameters of models of those ``libsbn`` parameters, which is contained in ``vip``.
``vip`` also contains routines for running and benchmarking inference.

The command-line interface is called ``vip`` and is available after installation (see ``vip.cli`` in the sidebar for docs).

If you want to write Python code using these tools, have a look at ``test/test_instance.py``.
To run this code and see results, execute::

    pytest -s test/test_instance.py
